PROBLEM STATEMENT
A retail store that has multiple outlets across the country are facing
issues in managing the inventory - to match the demand with respect
to supply.
1. You are provided with the weekly sales data for their various
outlets. Use statistical analysis, EDA, outlier analysis, and handle the
missing values to come up with various insights that can give them a
clear perspective on the following:
* If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if
yes which stores are suffering the most?
* If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could
be the reason?
* Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?
* How is the Consumer Price index affecting the weekly sales of
various stores?
* Top performing stores according to the historical data.
* The worst performing store, and how significant is the
difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.
2. Use predictive modelling techniques to forecast the sales for each
store for the next 12 weeks.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of the Walmart project is to analyze the weekly sales
data of multiple Walmart stores across the country and provide
insights to address the following questions:
•Determine if the weekly sales are affected by various factors like
Unemployment rate, Seasonality, Temperature and Consumer Price
Index (CPI)
•Identify top performing stores based on historical data.
•Identify the worst performing store and analyze the significance of
the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.
• Utilize predictive modelling techniques to forecast sales for each
store for the next 12 weeks.
The objective of this project is to address the inventory management
issues faced by a retail store with multiple outlets across the country
by leveraging statistical analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and
predictive modelling techniques. By achieving these objectives, the
retail store can gain a clearer perspective on the factors influencing
weekly sales, identify opportunities for improvement, and make
data-driven decisions to enhance inventory management and sales
performance across its multiple outlets.

DATA PREPROCESSING STEPS AND INSPIRATION
The preprocessing of the data includes the following steps:
* Checking for null values: - To improve accuracy by
replacing/removing null values.
* Checking for duplicate values: - To improve accuracy by
deleting duplicate values.
* Outlier Analysis: - Conduct outlier analysis for numerical
features like weekly sales, temperature, fuel price, CPI, and
unemployment rate and decide whether to remove outliers,
transform them, or keep them based on their impact on the
analysis and modeling.
* Data Visualization: - Visualize the distributions of numerical
features, correlations between features, and trends over time
using plots like scatter plots,pair plots and heatmaps. Explore
relationships between features and the target variable (weekly
sales) through visualizations to gain insights.
INSPIRATION: The inspiration for the project arise from several
perspectives, all aimed at addressing real-world challenges faced by
retail businesses like Walmart. Overall, the inspiration for this project
lies in the potential to extract actionable insights from retail sales
data, empowering businesses to make informed decisions, adapt to
market dynamics, and thrive in a competitive landscape.

CHOOSING THE ALGORITHM
* Data Visualization: I have chosen plotly library since it is a high
level data visualization library in which we can create interactive
plots and dashboards, that can be useful for exploring trends of
weekly sales over time.
* Time Series Forecasting: I have chosen Facebook Prophet library
for forecasting since it is an open source forecasting tool
developed by Facebook and here we don’t need to make the data
stationary. It is designed for creating accurate time series forecast.
Since walmart data typically involves time-series data (e.g., daily
or weekly sales), algorithms specialized in time series forecasting
are suitable. Facebook Prophet is a best choice for this task. It
handles trends and seasonality effects automatically, making it
suitable for modelling weekly sales over time. It can be used to
forecast the number of weekly sales expected in the future based
on historical data.

ASSUMPTIONS
* Linear Relationships: In the statistical analysis and predictive
modelling, we may assume linear relationships between variables,
such as sales and temperature, sales and unemployment rate, etc.
This assumption simplifies the modelling process and allows us to
use linear regression or related techniques.
* Independence of Observations: We assume that observations in
the time series data are independent of each other. This
assumption allows us to use standard statistical methods for
analysis and modelling. However, in reality, there may be
dependencies or autocorrelation between successive
observations, which may need to be addressed using time series
modelling techniques.
* Model Validity: We assume that the chosen forecasting algorithm
(e.g.FB Prophet) is appropriate for the data and problem context
and that the model assumptions are satisfied. While we have
evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics,
there may be limitations or uncertainties associated with the
model's validity, which should be considered when interpreting
the results.

MODEL EVALUATION AND TECHNIQUES
When evaluating the model we typically follow these steps:
* Preparation of Training data: Prepare the historical time series
data, ensuring it has a suitable format with a date time column
and the target variable we want to forecast.
* Model Initialization: Initialize a Prophet model object and
optionally set any relevant parameters like seasonality, holidays,
and growth.
from fbprophet import Prophet
model = Prophet()
* Fit the Model: Fit the Prophet model to your training data using
the fit method.
model.fit(data_train)
* Forecast Generation: Generate forecasts using the trained model.
We can specify the number of periods in future that we want to
forecast using make_future_dataframe() method and then make
predictions using the predict method.
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=12)
* Visual Evaluation: Plot the actual values against the predicted
values to visually inspect how well the model performs on the
training data.
model.plot(forecast)
  
INFERENCES
* Store-Level Performance:
a. Through historical sales data analysis, top-performing stores were
identified based on their consistent high sales volumes.
b. Store-specific factors such as location, and local economic
conditions likely contribute to differences in sales performance
across stores.
* Impact of External Factors: The analysis revealed that external
factors such as temperature, holidays, fuel prices, consumer price
index (CPI), and unemployment rate significantly influence weekly
sales.
a. Higher temperatures tend to correlate with increased sales,
suggesting that warmer weather may lead to higher consumer
demand for certain products.
b. Holidays, especially major ones like Christmas and
Thanksgiving, result in spikes in sales, indicating seasonal
effects on consumer behavior.
  
FUTURE POSSIBILITIES
* Advanced Predictive Modelling Techniques:
a. Explore advanced machine learning algorithms beyond
Prophet, such as deep learning models (e.g., LSTM networks) or
ensemble methods, to capture complex relationships and
nonlinear patterns in the data.
b. Experiment with hybrid forecasting approaches that combine
statistical methods with machine learning techniques for
improved forecast accuracy.
* Real-Time Forecasting: Develop capabilities for real-time or near-
real-time sales forecasting to enable Walmart to respond quickly
to changing market conditions, demand fluctuations, and external
events.
By exploring these future possibilities, Walmart can further enhance
its sales forecasting capabilities, drive operational efficiencies, and
gain a competitive advantage in the dynamic retail landscape.
Additionally, continuous innovation and adaptation to emerging
technologies and market trends will position walmart for sustained
growth and success in the future.
  
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, the sales forecasting project undertaken for Walmart
provides valuable insights into the factors influencing weekly sales at
their various stores across the country. Through a combination of
exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling
using the Prophet algorithm, and model evaluation techniques, we
have gained a deeper understanding of sales trends, seasonality, and
the impact of external factors such as unemployment rate,
temperature, and consumer price index.
In summary, the Walmart project represents a comprehensive effort
to tackle inventory management issues through data-driven analysis
and strategic planning, laying the foundation for continued success
and innovation in the retail industry.
